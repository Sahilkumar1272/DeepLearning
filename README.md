# DeepLearning Repository

## Overview
This repository contains my implementations and projects related to Deep Learning concepts and algorithms. Each assignment or project is organized with proper documentation and code.

## 📁 Current Contents

### Assignment 1: Simple Neural Network Implementation
- **File**: `Assignment_1_NN.ipynb`
- **Description**: Implementation of a 3-layer neural network (1 neuron per layer) to approximate the function f(x) = exp(-sin(x²)/2) + x
- **Features**:
  - Forward and backward propagation implemented from scratch
  - Gradient descent optimization
  - Visualization of results
  - Performance analysis

## 🔮 Future Plans
This repository will be updated with:
- More complex neural network architectures
- Different optimization algorithms
- Computer vision applications
- Natural language processing projects
- Reinforcement learning implementations

## 🚀 Usage
Each project includes its own Jupyter notebook with executable code and detailed comments. Simply open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter to run the experiments.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Google Colab

## 📝 About
This repository is maintained as part of my learning journey in Deep Learning.
